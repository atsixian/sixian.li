During this year's Spring Festival, I spent a lot of time on [type-challenges](https://github.com/type-challenges/type-challenges), practicing challenge after challenge. And then, it happened: I finally **understood** TypeScript. It's not just about "type annotations"; rather, it can be highly reactive, with types being inputs for other types, and a small change triggering a chain of changes. Everything is so well-constrained. Your types flow.

My attempt to reconstruct a detailed proof for a remark on [Luc Devroye's note of MST](http://luc.devroye.org/HenriMertens-ShortestPath+MST-2019.pdf).

## Max edge in a spanning tree

Let $T$ be a spanning tree of $G(V,E)$ and $L(T) = max_{(u,v)\in T}\ w[u, v]$, the longest edge in a spanning tree.

$\text{Claim: The minimum spanning tree also minimizes L(T), that is, }$

$$
L(MST) = min_{all\ T} L(T)
$$

$\text{Proof:}$

"$\geq$"

MST$\in$T, so L(MST) cannot be less than the **minimum** L(T) of all T's.

"$\leq$"

In the figure above, we assume the red arrow is the longest edge in MST. We construct the MST by adding the shortest "bridge" each time we cross two sets, $A$ and $V-A$. Thus, all other grey edges are **longer** than or equal to the red edge. These grey edges are in some other spanning trees.

For convenience, take one grey edge and call it $(x,y)$ because it's from some vertex $x\in A$ to $y \in V-A$. If it's the max edge of its spanning tree, $T_x$. $L(T_x) \geq L(MST)$.
If it's not, there exists a max edge $(x',y')$ in $T_x$ such that $(x',y') \gt (x, y) \geq L(MST)$. So $L(T_x) \geq L(MST)$.

Q.E.D

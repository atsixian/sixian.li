## Goals:

1. Write a script to remap mouse buttons
2. Run the script when the wireless mouse is connected

---

This is my mouse:

<Image

/>

The default right-click is the bottom right button, but I would like to use the top right button instead.

## Remap mouse buttons

First, `xinput` gives the id and name assigned to my mouse. Then, `xinput list 18(device id)` gives information about all buttons on my mouse.

```shell
$ xinput
...
⎜   ↳ Expert Wireless TB Mouse                	id=18	[slave  pointer  (2)]

$ xinput list 18
Expert Wireless TB Mouse                	id=18	[slave  pointer  (2)]
	Reporting 7 classes:
		Class originated from: 18. Type: XIButtonClass
		Buttons supported: 9
		Button labels: "Button Left" "Button Middle" "Button Right" "Button Wheel Up" "Button Wheel Down" "Button Horiz Wheel Left" "Button Horiz Wheel Right" "Button Side" "Button Extra"
```

However, the labels are quite confusing. To find out which button is pressed, run `xinput test 18(device id)` and press buttons you want to switch.

```bash
$ xinput test 18
button press   8
button release 8
button press   3
button release 3
```

This is much clearer than the "Button Side". To remap buttons, simply use `xinput set-button-map $mouse_id 1 2 8 4 5 6 7 3 9` which switches `3` and `8`.

**Problem:** When I restart the laptop, everything goes back to the default settings. With the help of [StackOverflow](https://askubuntu.com/questions/492744/how-do-i-automatically-remap-buttons-on-my-mouse-at-startup), I created a script called `remap_mouse_buttons.sh`:

```bash
mouse_id=$(xinput list | grep "Expert Wireless TB Mouse" | sed 's/^.*id=\([0-9]*\)[ \t].*/\1/')
xinput set-button-map $mouse_id 1 2 8 4 5 6 7 3 9
```

I added this to the Start Up Applications. Unfortunately, this didn't work because if I didn't connect the mouse when the computer started, the system wouldn't find the device let alone remap buttons.

_NOTE:_ I highly recommend you keep track of the error message by changing the second line to:

```bash
xinput set-button-map $mouse_id  1 2 8 4 5 6 7 3 9 2>&1 | sudo tee /home/yourusername/error.txt
```

## Run the script when the mouse is connected

What I should do is executing the script when the mouse is connected via Bluetooth. [udev](https://wiki.debian.org/udev) rules are perfect for this job.

This [tutorial](https://linuxconfig.org/tutorial-on-how-to-write-basic-udev-rules-in-linux) on how to write basic udev rules helped me a lot.

```bash
# Where custom made rules are
$ cd /etc/udev/rules.d/
# The naming convention is xx-description.rules. "xx" is a number, and the larger it is, the later it will be executed
$ sudo touch 88-remapmouse.rules
```

Before writing rules, we need to gather information about the device. Run `udevadm monitor` and reconnect the device to get its path. Then, run `udevadm info` to get detailed information.

```bash
$udevadm monitor
monitor will print the received events for:
UDEV - the event which udev sends out after rule processing
KERNEL - the kernel uevent

KERNEL[8572.460135] remove   /devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:14.0/usb1/1-7/1-7:1.0/bluetooth/hci0/hci0:3585 (bluetooth)
KERNEL[8572.465756] add      /devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:14.0/usb1/1-7/1-7:1.0/bluetooth/hci0/hci0:3585 (bluetooth)
UDEV  [8572.525910] remove   /devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:14.0/usb1/1-7/1-7:1.0/bluetooth/hci0/hci0:3585 (bluetooth)
UDEV  [8572.582738] add      /devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:14.0/usb1/1-7/1-7:1.0/bluetooth/hci0/hci0:3585 (bluetooth)

# The output has been truncated
$ udevadm info -ap /devices/pci0000:00/00:00:14.0/usb1/1-7/1-7:1.0/bluetooth/hci0/hci0:3585
...
looking at device '/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:14.0/usb1/1-7/1-7:1.0/bluetooth/hci0/hci0:3585':
    KERNEL=="hci0:3585"
    SUBSYSTEM=="bluetooth"
    DRIVER==""
	...
looking at parent device '/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:14.0/usb1/1-7':
    KERNELS=="1-7"
    SUBSYSTEMS=="usb"
    DRIVERS=="usb"
	...
    ATTRS{idProduct}=="0a2b"
    ATTRS{idVendor}=="8087"
    ...
```

Now we have enough info to write the `88-remapmouse.rules`:

```text
ACTION=="add",\
SUBSYSTEMS=="usb",\
ATTRS{idProduct}=="0a2b",\
ATTRS{idVendor}=="8087",\
ENV{DISPLAY}=":0.0",\
ENV{XAUTHORITY}="/run/user/1000/gdm/Xauthority",\
RUN+="/home/lisixian/remap_mouse.sh"
```

`==` match the value

`=` assign a value (overwrite)

`+=` add another value

The script seems daunting, but what it says is simply "When the device with matching values is detected(connected), run `/home/lisixian/remap_mouse.sh` (the script in the first section)".

_NOTE:_ `ENV{DISPLAY}=":0.0"` and `ENV{XAUTHORITY}="/run/user/1000/gdm/Xauthority` are important. From the tutorial:

> Those variables are essential when interacting with the X server programmatically, to setup some needed information: with the `DISPLAY` variable, we specify on what machine the server is running, what display and what screen we are referencing, and with `XAUTHORITY` we provide the path to the file which contains Xorg authentication and authorization information.

I got `Cannot connect to X server` error without these two lines.

Finally!

```bash
udevadm control --reload # reload all rules
```

Now, disconnect your device and connect again to see the results.

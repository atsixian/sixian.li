## Question

How many ways can you write an integer `n` as the sum of a decreasing sequence(excluding `n+0`)?

Let’s look at an example from [Wikipedia](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_(number_theory)>):

> Alternatively, we could count partitions in which no number occurs more than once. Such a partition is called a _partition with distinct parts_. If we count the partitions of 8 with distinct parts, we also obtain 6:
>
> - 8
> - 7 + 1
> - 6 + 2
> - 5 + 3
> - 5 + 2 + 1
> - 4 + 3 + 1

The problem boils down to find the number of _partition with distinct parts_ and simply subtract 1 from it. So I’ll focus on the core part.

## Solution

Doing it by hand is easy. We choose the first element, e.g., 5, figure out `8-5=3`, and try to split `3` into smaller parts. For human beings, checking “`3` is less than `5`” on paper happens in an instant. But we need a way to tell the computer what is the current max, so it knows possible choices for the next number.

### Recursion

#### Visualize the result

Before we directly count the total number of sequences, it helps to visualize the result. Based on the idea from [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/14162865):

Translate `partition(n, maxi)` into English: Parition the number `n` into a decreasing sequence where the first element(largest one) is no bigger than `maxi`.

`min(n-i, i-1)` is to ensure the sequence is decreasing, and the max is no more than the number itself. To see that, let $M = min(n-i, i-1) \Rightarrow M \leq i-1 \text{ and } M \leq n-i$.

This also avoids extra calculations because the size for each part can’t be more than what we have. For example, `partition(5, 5) = partition(5, 14)`, so we don’t need to run the loop from 6 to 14.

```python
def partition(n: int, maxi: int)-> List[int]:
    if n == 0: return [[]]
    results = []
    # 1 <= i <= n. If max = 0, we won't have any partition.
    for i in range(maxi, 0, -1):
      	# n-i is what remains after taking away i from n.
        subresults = partition(n - i, min(n-i, i-1))
        results.extend([ [i] + sub for sub in subresults])
    return results
```

<br />

```shell
> partition(5, 5)
[[5], [4, 1], [3, 2]]

> partition(10, 5)
[[5, 4, 1], [5, 3, 2], [4, 3, 2, 1]]

> partition(10, 10)
[[10], [9, 1], [8, 2], [7, 3], [7, 2, 1], [6, 4], [6, 3, 1], [5, 4, 1], [5, 3, 2], [4, 3, 2,1]]
```

<br />

#### Let’s count the total number

Base case is `0`. When we have `count_p(0, i-1)`, it means `n=i or n=0`, so the only possible partition is `n = n` no matter what the max is.

```python
def count_p(n, maxi):
  if n == 0: return 1
  result = 0
  for i in range(maxi, 0, -1):
    result += count_p(n-i, min(n-i, i-1))
  return result
```

<br />

```shell
> count_p(10, 10)
10
> count_p(5, 5)
3
> count_p(200, 200)
... waiting ...
```

It works, but it’s super inefficient. To see where recalculations happen, I modified the function as below:

```python
from collections import Counter

def count_p_recalc(n, maxi, pool):
    if n == 0: return pool
    for i in range(maxi, 0, -1):
        pool[(n, i)] += 1
        pool = count_p_recalc(n - i, min(n - i, i - 1), pool)
    return pool

print(count_p_recalc(20, 20, Counter()).most_common(5))

# Result format: ((n, maxi), #number of recalcualtions)
# [((1, 1), 29), ((2, 1), 25), ((3, 1), 21), ((4, 1), 17), ((2, 2), 15)]
```

If these results are stored somewhere, we can avoid all recalculations and just use it.

### Dynamic Programming

```python {12}
def P(n):

    size = n + 1
    # initialize the table
    p = [[0 for _ in range(size)] for _ in range(size)]

    p[0][0] = 1
    for i in range(size):
        for j in range(1, size):
         		# The same idea: we don't care about more than what we have
            if j <= i:
                p[i][j] = p[i][j - 1] + p[i - j][min(i - j, j - 1)]

    return p[n][n]
```

Let's decipher the highlighted line:

`p[i][j]`: Partition the integer `i` into a decreasing sequence with the first element(largest one) **less than or equal to ** `j`. Here we are accumulating the result. Say we want to partition 8. After selecting 5 as the first element, we want to find **all decreasing sequences starting with 4 or less that sum to 8-5=3**. As long as the first element is less than 5, the sequence is valid.

`p[i][j-1] +`: Accumulate the result as explained above.

`p[i-j][min(i-j, j-1)]`: Find all valid subsequences from `i-j`(what’s left). This corresponds to our recursion `partitoin(n-i, min(n-i, i-1))`.

Finally, we can find our result at `p[n][n]`: partition the integer `n` with the starting element less than or equal to `n`. This is exactly what we’re looking for.

If you want to exclude `n=n+0`, just `return p[n][n]-1`.

Here’s the table from `P(8)`. The result is at `p[8, 8] = 6` as we expected.

```text
[
 [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 1, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 3, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6]
]
```

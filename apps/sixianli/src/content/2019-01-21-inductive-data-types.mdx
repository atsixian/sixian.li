### Lists as inductive structures

- NOTE: Induction works if and only if the system has a well-founded order.

### Inductive definitions of data types

Let `[ ]` is a list. If you have a list, say `l`, and an item, say`i`, then `i::l` is also a list.
`List0 = [ ]`
`List1 = [1], [2],...,[ ]`
`List2 = [1; 1], [1; 2],...,[4; 1],...`
The entire collection LIST = union_n LIST_n, an infinite set. However, the description is short, concise, and finite.
This is a built-in type. There are functions like `map, filter` in this module.

### How do I define my own inductive types?

Lists are linear data types, tail recursion works well for linear data types.

#### Trees

Trees are **not built-in**. Here we only talked about binary trees.

- Inductive definition:
  `EMPTY` is a tree.
  If `t1, t2` are trees, and `i` is an item. Then `i(t1, t2)` is a tree (NOT linear).

- How to code a `Tree` in OCaml
  We have user-defined inductive types.
  `type 'a tree = Empty | Node of 'a tree * 'a * 'a tree`

  1. `'a means:`Polymorphic binary trees. `'a` can be instantiated with any type: ints, strings...

     You don't have to declare types. Type inference comes to help.

     `let max (n, m) = if n < m then m else n;;`

  2. `Node`: constructor function. Always start with capital letters.

  - Examples:

    ```ocaml
    let t1 = Node(Empty, 0, (Node(Empty, 1, Empty)));;

    (* height *)
    let rec height (t: 'a tree) =
    	match t with
    	| Empty -> 0
    	| Node (l,_,r) -> 1 + max(height l, height r);;

    (* sumNodes *)
    (* showInt*)
    (* inOrder *)
    (* (inOrder l); (showInt n); (inOrder r);;
    	The ; suggests sequence. It's not pure.
    *)
    (* flatten *)
    ```

- Expression trees

  `Const, Var, Plus, Times`

  `type binding`: char \* int

  `type env = binding list`

  `let rho: env = [('x', 11); ('y', 7); ('z', 2)]`

  What if there's no such names?

  - OPTION TYPE, a new type constructor. If `t` is a type, then `t option` is another type. Allows you to optionally return a `NOne` value.

  - EX. 1729 is an integer.

    None is an integer option.

    Some 1729 is an integer option.

    Not returning int value, return `int option`.

```ocaml
let rec eval (e: exptree) (rho: env) =
	match e with
	| Const n -> n
	| Var v -> (match (lookup v rho)) with
				| None -> raise NotFound
				| Some r -> r
```

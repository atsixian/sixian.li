Some useful explanations for `fold` functions in OCaml.

---

#### fold_right

Let's start with two functions: `sum` and `concat`

```ocaml
let rec sum = function
| [] -> 0
| h::t -> h + sum t

let rec concat = function
| [] -> ""
| h::t -> h ^ concat t
```

We notice that these two functions are very similar. The only differences are the base case value (`0` and `""`) and the operator (`+` and `^`).

We love descriptionions. So we rewrite these two functions as

```ocaml
let rec combine op init = function
| [] -> init
| h::t -> op h (combine op init t)
```

Why is it called fold_right?

Because the associativity is from right to left like this:

`(a+(b+(c+0)))`

#### fold_left

Similarly, the associativity, as its name suggests, is `((a+0)+b)+c)`. It is actually a handy function for tail recursion.

It is implemented like this:

`fold_left op acc(base case) list`

> In `fold_right`, you will notice that the value passed as the `init`argument is the same for every recursive invocation of `fold_right`: it's passed all the way down to where it's needed, at the right-most element of the list, then used there exactly once. But in `fold_left`, you will notice that at each recursive invocation, the value passed as the argument `acc` can be different.

NOTE: In `fold_left`, its type is:

`('a -> 'b -> 'a) -> 'a -> 'b list -> 'a = <fun>`
In the example `rev` below, the function is `fun l a` instead of `fun a l`

#### Examples

```ocaml
(* reverse a list *)
let rev lst = fold_left (fun l a -> a::l) [] lst

(* calculate the length of a list*)
let len lst = fold_left (fun a _ -> a+1) 0 lst

(* map in fold*)
let mapp f lst = fold_right (fun e_of_l init -> (f e_of_l)::init) lst [] ;;

(* filter in fold*)
let filterr f lst = fold_right (fun e_of_l init -> if (f e_of_l) then e_of_l::init else init) lst [] ;;

```

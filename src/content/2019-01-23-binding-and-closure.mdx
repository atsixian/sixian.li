## Binding & Closure

_Binding_ created a `(name, value)` pair. Here, values can also be functions.

_Declarations_ create bindings.

```ocaml
let x = 3 in x+2 ;;
```

- `let`: declaration
- `in`: scope
- **NOTE**: Do not confuse this with assignment.

### 3 components of closure

1. parameters
2. body
3. pointer to the environment when it is defined (**static binding**, **lexical scoping**)

NOTE: Environment can only be added, so there are layers. The pointer is pointing to the correct environment. A layer will be swept by garbage collection when there is no pointer points to it.

#### [Side note](https://beginnersbook.com/2013/04/java-static-dynamic-binding/): static binding and dynamic binding in Java:

> - Static binding
>
>   ...So whenever a binding of static, private and final methods happen, **type of the class** is determined by the compiler at **compile time** (**not** determined by type of the object) and the binding happens then and there.
>
> - Dynamic binding
>
>   The **type of the object** is determined at the runtime(by the `new someconstructor()` keyword).
>
> - Overload and Override
>
>   The binding of [overloaded methods](https://beginnersbook.com/2013/05/method-overloading/) is static and the binding of overridden methods is dynamic.

### Binding vs. Assignment

In an imperative language, like Java, when we assign a value to a variable, we make an analogy between our `variable` and `box`. A variable itself is a container, and it holds some value. However, when we **bind** a name to a variable, we are attaching a **label** on that **value**.

Consider the code snippet below.

`y = x + 1` is not closed on the name `x`. It is **closed** on the value **3** which was bound to `x`. So `y` will never change with `x`.

A really good explanation from [stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48100145/binding-vs-assignment):

> You can think of binding as a label on a suitcase, and assignment as a suitcase.

Now, let's look at this example:

```ocaml
let x = 3 in
	let f = fun x -> x in
 	let x = 99 in
 	f x
```

**Layers**

`x | 99`

`f | (3 components)` parameter: x | body: x | pointer to `x = 3`

`x | 3`

When we evaluate `f x`:

1.  `f` is a closure, should be a function
2.  Now its parameter is x! Let's look for `x`
3.  Ok, `x` is 99. Let's evaluate. At this point, the layer `x | 99` will go along with the pointer to the layer `x | 3`. **IMPORTANT: 3 is masked because 99 is on the top layer.**

```ocaml
let x = 3 in (* binding *)
	let y = x + 1 in
	let x = 2 in
	x + y
```

When you evaluate this, `x` is not built-in. It is stored in a structure called <u>environment</u>. So the compiler will look for what is `x`.

`x | 3` ---> base environment

`x + 2` to be evaluated. `x` is found in the top layer.

**Layers**

`x | 2`

`y | 4`

`x | 3`

|||BASE ENV|||

**<u>NOTE</u>**: Never put <u>bindings</u> in the value part. It looks for `x` in the environment, and put the value of `x` in `x+1`.

Here, `x-3` is **masked, but it is still there**. During the evaluation, it picks the `x` in the top layer.

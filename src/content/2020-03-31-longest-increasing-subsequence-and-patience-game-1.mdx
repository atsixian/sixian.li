This part focuses on the idea behind the solution. The actual implementation will be covered in Part2.

## Problem

Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of longest increasing subsequence. Example from [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-increasing-subsequence/):

```
Input: [10,9,2,5,3,7,101,18]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest increasing subsequence is [2,3,7,101], therefore the length is 4.
```

The $O(n^2)$ dynamic programming solution is quite straightforward. But I’m surprised to see the relationship between the card game **Patience** and LIS.

## Patience

**Rules**

1. You can only place a lowered-valued(or equal-valued) card on top of a higher-valued card, e.g., `2` on top of `3`. Note Ace is NOT `1` here.

2. You can form a new pile and put your card onto it.

To understand why it’s related to LIS, we need to make two observations.

### Observation1

**For any legal strategy, $\#\text{piles}$ $\geq$ length of any increasing subsequence**

![Card](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Deerhound579/image-hosting/img/deck.png)

**Claim**: Any increasing subsequence can use **at most one** card from each pile.

#### Proof

Assume we used $y$ and $y'$ from this pile. Since $y$ is on top of $y'$, $y \le y’$.

If $y = y’$, they can’t form an **increasing** sequence. **“increasing”** is different from **"non-decreasing”**.

If $y \lt y’$, the only way to use both cards in an **increasing sequence** is to place $y'$ after $y$ in that sequence. But $y$ is on top of $y'$, so $y'$ comes **before** $y$ in the original array.

For example, `[y', y] = [5, 2]`, `5 -> 2` is not an IS.

Thus, you can’t form an IS with more than one card from a pile $\Rightarrow$ length of any IS is at most $\#\text{piles}$.

### Greedy algorithm

Idea: put the new card on the leftmost pile possible, i.e., the first pile from left to right, such that $\text{new card} \le \text{top card of the pile}$.

If we play the game with this strategy, we will notice that top cards form an IS(increasing sequence). For example,

![IS](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Deerhound579/image-hosting/img/game1.jpeg)

`2 4 7 8 Q` is an IS.

Let’s prove this.

### Observation2

**Using the greedy strategy, top cards of piles increase from left to right at any time of the game**

#### Proof

![Deck](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Deerhound579/image-hosting/img/deck.png)

Assume $x \lt y$, so we don’t have an IS. We have two cases:

1. $y$ comes before $x$

   Then $x$ must be placed on top of $y$ by the algorithm. Contradiction.

2. $y$ comes after $x$

   Since $x$ is put into the red pile, $x \gt y'$ or it’ll be in the blue pile by our greedy algorithm. $y$ is on top of $y'$, so $y \le y'$. But we assumed $x \lt y$, so $x \lt y \le y'$ which contradicts $x\gt y'$.

With these two observations, we can go head and prove the duality.

## Duality

### Lenght of LIS = #piles using the greedy strategy

Let the length of LIS be $L$, and $P$ be the $\#\text{piles}$ created by the greedy algorithm. For an inequality, we have to show $“\geq”$ and $“\leq”$ directions.

1. $L \leq P$

This follows directly from $\#\text{piles}\geq$ length of nay IS in observation 1. LIS is an IS, so $L \leq P$.

2. $L \geq P$

From observation 2, we know top cards of piles increase from left to right at **any time** of the game using this algorithm.

> Note that the top cards are in general not an increasing subsequence — [Berkeley notes](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spring13/cos423/lectures/LongestIncreasingSubsequence.pdf)

In this case, the top cards are `2 4 7 8 Q`, but `4` comes **after** `7` in the original deck, so `4 -> 7` is not an IS.

![Pointer](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Deerhound579/image-hosting/img/pointer1.png)

To keep track of a valid IS, **at the time of insertion** of a card $c$, we keep a pointer from $c$ to the current top card to the left of $c$. For example, when `5` is inserted, `3` is the top card on its left, so there’s an arrow from `5` to `3`.

Assume $P \gt L$, let the top card on the $i\text{th}$ pile be $a_i$. Since we have $P$ piles, we can follow the pointers starting at $a_p$ to get $a_1\leftarrow…\leftarrow a_{p-1} \leftarrow a_p$. Note that from left to right, $a_1 \lt a_2 \lt \cdots \lt a_p$. Thus, we get an IS of length $P$.

But we claimed the length of the **longest** IS is $L$. $P \gt L$ contraditcts that, so $P \leq L \  \square$

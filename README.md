## Sixian's personal website

In 2019, I built my [old blog](netlify.sixian.li). Orange was the primary color, bold and vibrant. The beautiful epicycle drawing animation that I'm still proud of today was inspired by [3Blue1Brown](https://youtu.be/r6sGWTCMz2k) and [Coding Train](https://thecodingtrain.com/challenges/130-drawing-with-fourier-transform-and-epicycles). Over the past few years, I have grown, and my mindset has changed. This time, when I decided to rebuild my blog, I make it monochrome and put some cool visual effects in more subtle places, focusing on simplicity and readability.

I still love orange, but I found monochrome to be more timeless and peaceful.
